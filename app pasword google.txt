Sign in with app passwords
Important: App passwords aren't recommended and are unnecessary in most cases. To help keep your account secure, use "Sign in with Google" to connect apps to your Google Account.
An app password is a 16-digit passcode that gives a less secure app or device permission to access your Google Account. App passwords can only be used with accounts that have 2-Step Verification turned on.

When to use app passwords
Tip: iPhones and iPads with iOS 11 or up don't require app passwords. Instead use "Sign in with Google."

If the app doesn't offer "Sign in with Google," you can either:

Use app passwords
Switch to a more secure app or device
Create & use app passwords
Important: To create an app password, you need 2-Step Verification on your Google Account.

If you use 2-Step-Verification and get a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an app password.

Create and manage your app passwords. You may need to sign in to your Google Account.

If you've set up 2-Step Verification but can't find the option to add an app password, it might be because:

Your Google Account has 2-Step Verification set up only for security keys.
You're logged into a work, school, or another organization account.
Your Google Account has Advanced Protection.
